# Slides and Handouts for Teching (Kids) Coding

## Slides

Slides use the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) JavaScript presentation framwork. There is an "index" slide that links to available presentations.

## Handouts

Handouts are made using (most) of the reveal.js CSS. It simplifies the HTML structure a bit and overrides some of the CSS for better print layout.

## Installation

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed. It can be installed via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), both of which can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### Install dependencies

    npm install

### Run Presentaion

   npm start

### Print Handouts

Just open the html file and print.
